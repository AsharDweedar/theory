- **difference between authentication & authorization?**

  authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to.

- **What are JWT / Oauth2?**

  **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a way to encode claims in a JSON document that is then signed. JWTs can be used to encode all relevant parts of an access token into the access token itself instead of having to store them in a database.
