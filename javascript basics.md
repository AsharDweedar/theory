##Theoretical part :

```
[ ] Is JavaScript a functional language? What does it mean for a language to be “functional”?
[ ] Give a brief analogy explaining how computer memory works to a beginning programmer.
[ ] What’s a “declarative” language?
[ ] Benefits of using  arrow functions?
[ ] How are promises used?
```

==================================================
1-
a- Is JavaScript a functional language?
well , that's actually up to your thoughts ... :P
b- What does it mean for a language to be “functional”?
to be able to build functions inside it based on **lambda-calculas** (whatever that means) , which is done by declarations or impressions ...

---

2- Give a brief analogy explaining how computer memory works to a beginning programmer.
using a connecting bus between the cpu and the different types of memory to allow data to be fetched or stored at memory units ....

---

3- What’s a “declarative” language?
any other language than imparative .. which depends on declaring operations without describing how the program should accomplish them ...

---

4- Arrow syntax automatically binds this to the surrounding code's context. The syntax allows an implicit return when there is no body block, resulting in shorter and simpler code in some cases

---

5- promises used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.
