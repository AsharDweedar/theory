abstraction is a way in java to define dethodes in an abstracted class without defining the implementation so it will be left to the subclasses to define the implementation separately .. 

example :  define creature as abstract class that defines abstract methodes to it's subclasses that extends it (aging, eating, growth , .. ), then each subclass like animals , humans, plants ,... define their own   implementation for it
