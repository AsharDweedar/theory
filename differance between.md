|                take the statment and excute it                 |  takes the whole code and analyze it then excute it  |
|          faster in analyzeing but slower at excuting           |   slower at analyzing code and faster in excuting    |
|                        easier to debug                         |                   harder to debug                    |
| it takes a statment by a statment and stop at any bug it finds | it scans the whole code then sends the error message |
